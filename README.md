Just some scripts/tools I've written to improve my workflow.  A brief discription of each script/tool is provided below.

##  makeTests (wip)
Creates tests cases in verilog for every possible case for the given variables, and optional states

##  unzip-all (wip)
Takes a target directory with n zipped folders inside and creates a new directory will all n zipped folders unzipped.
